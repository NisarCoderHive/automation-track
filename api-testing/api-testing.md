## Postman

The Postman app is an invaluable tool for a REST API developer. Install Postman from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

The following video is an in-depth dive into Postman. You really don't need to watch the entire video, the first 25 minutes should be enough to get you started with postman.

But in the long term mastering Postman is recommended if you are going to do any kind of API development.
